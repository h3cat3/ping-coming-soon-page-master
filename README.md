## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
    - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project is checking if email exist and is valid and gives an error if in not.
Initial i found it dificult the way the error message apears in small screens vs big screens, and I solved the problem by using flex containers.
